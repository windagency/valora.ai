# Task Refinement Command

## Role

Use the [agent] profile

## Goal

**Transform a fetched task into a crystal-clear, implementation-ready specification** by:

1. **Analyzing task clarity** - Identify ambiguities, gaps, and assumptions
2. **Clarifying requirements** - Ask targeted questions to resolve uncertainties
3. **Defining acceptance criteria** - Ensure testable, measurable success conditions
4. **Establishing context** - Link to PRD, codebase patterns, and constraints
5. **Collecting user answers** - Gather responses to clarifying questions interactively
6. **Validating readiness** - Confirm task is ready for technical planning
7. **Preparing handoff** - Package refined task for `/plan` command

**This command bridges product requirements (WHAT) and technical planning (HOW).**

## Context

### Input Arguments

```plaintext
$ARGUMENTS
```

### Task Source

```structured
<details>
<summary>Identify task to refine</summary>

Task can come from:
1. Most recent task from `/fetch-task` (stored in TODO.md)
2. Explicit task ID via --task-id parameter
3. User-provided task description inline
4. Task reference from BACKLOG.md

Priority: Explicit parameter > Recent fetch > User input
</details>
```

### Related Documentation

```structured
<details>
<summary>Gather context documents</summary>

Check for:
- knowledge-base/PRD.md (functional requirements)
- knowledge-base/BACKLOG.md (task dependencies)
- knowledge-base/backend/ARCHITECTURE.md (technical patterns)
- knowledge-base/frontend/ARCHITECTURE.md (UI patterns)
- knowledge-base/FUNCTIONAL.md (user flows)
- TODO.md (current project state)
</details>
```

## Process Steps

### Step 1: Load Task & Analyze Current State

**Objective**: Retrieve task details and assess current clarity level.

**Actions**: Execute `context.load-task` prompt to:

- Locate task from TODO.md, BACKLOG.md, or user input
- Extract all task components and metadata
- Load related PRD requirements and context
- Assess initial clarity baseline

**Output**: Task loaded + initial assessment

---

### Step 2: Analyze Clarity & Identify Gaps

**Objective**: Systematically identify areas requiring clarification.

**Actions**: Execute `onboard.analyze-clarity` prompt to:

- Calculate clarity score across 5 dimensions
- Identify specific ambiguities and gaps
- Prioritize gaps (P0/P1/P2)
- Categorize by type (requirements/criteria/context/scope/dependencies)

**Clarity Thresholds**:

- **≥ 85%**: Mostly clear, minor refinement needed
- **60-84%**: Moderate clarity, requires focused clarification
- **< 60%**: Major gaps, needs significant refinement

**Output**: Clarity score + categorized gaps + priorities

---

### Step 3: Refine Requirements & Resolve Ambiguities

**Objective**: Resolve ambiguities through questioning or inference.

**Actions**: Execute `onboard.refine-requirements` prompt to:

**If `--interactive` mode**:

- Generate 3-5 targeted questions with options
- Present to user and await responses
- Iterate until P0 gaps resolved

**If auto mode** (default):

- Make reasonable inferences from codebase patterns
- Reference PRD requirements and similar tasks
- Apply standard domain practices
- Document all assumptions with confidence levels
- Flag high-risk assumptions for validation

**Output**: Refined requirements + questions OR assumptions documented

---

### Step 4: Validate Testability

**Objective**: Ensure acceptance criteria are testable and complete.

**Actions**: Execute `review.validate-testability` prompt to:

- Evaluate criteria using SMART framework
- Check coverage (happy path/edge/error/non-functional)
- Map criteria to test types (unit/integration/e2e/manual)
- Calculate testability score
- Identify any remaining gaps

**Testability Thresholds**:

- **≥ 90%**: Excellent, ready for planning
- **80-89%**: Good, minor improvements suggested
- **< 80%**: Needs additional refinement

**Output**: Testability score + test strategy + readiness assessment

---

### Step 5: Collect User Clarifications

**Objective**: Collect user answers to clarifying questions generated during refinement.

**Actions**: Execute `onboard.collect-clarifications` prompt to:

- Present clarifying questions from the refine stage
- Collect user answers interactively
- Generate summary of decisions for documentation
- Track questions answered vs skipped

**Condition**: Only runs if clarifying questions were generated in Step 3.

**Output**: User answers + summary + questions answered/skipped

---

### Step 6: Calculate Final Readiness & Validate

**Objective**: Confirm task is ready for planning phase.

**Readiness Checklist**:

- [ ] Requirements are clear (no ambiguity)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria complete (all scenarios covered)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria testable (SMART compliant)
- [ ] Scope is bounded (in/out explicit)
- [ ] Dependencies identified and validated

```

**Quality Gates**:

- **≥ 85%**: ✅ Ready for `/plan`
- **70-84%**: ⚠️ Mostly ready, proceed with caution
- **< 70%**: ❌ Not ready, needs more work

**Output**: Readiness score + validation report

---

## Rules & Constraints

### DO

✅ **Follow the pipeline** - Execute prompts in sequence  
✅ **Use interactive mode** - When P0 gaps exist or task is critical  
✅ **Document assumptions** - In auto mode, make reasoning explicit  
✅ **Validate completeness** - Don't skip readiness checks  
✅ **Link to PRD** - Maintain traceability to requirements  
✅ **Prepare for planning** - Package context for next phase  
✅ **Focus on WHAT** - Requirements, not implementation details

### DON'T

❌ **Don't skip prompts** - Each stage is necessary for quality  
❌ **Don't prescribe HOW** - That's for planning phase  
❌ **Don't rush validation** - Quality gates prevent rework  
❌ **Don't accept vague criteria** - Use prompts to refine  
❌ **Don't ignore non-functional requirements** - Performance, security, a11y matter  
❌ **Don't change scope** - Flag issues but maintain boundaries  
❌ **Don't proceed if not ready** - Low readiness → iterate or escalate

## Integration with Workflow

**Entry Point**: After `/fetch-task` (Task Preparation Phase - see WORKFLOW.md)

**Prerequisites**:

- ✅ Task fetched from backlog (via `/fetch-task`)
- ✅ Task exists in BACKLOG.md with basic details
- ✅ PRD available for requirement linking
- ✅ Relevant architecture docs accessible

**Exits**:

- ✅ **Success (Ready)**: → `/plan [TASK-ID]` (Planning Phase begins)
- 🔄 **Needs More Context**: → `/gather-knowledge` then return to `/refine-task`
- 🔄 **Low Readiness**: → Iterate `/refine-task --interactive` with more input
- ⚠️ **Scope Issues**: → `/refine-specs` or `/create-backlog` (task definition problem)
- ⚠️ **Blocker Discovered**: → Resolve dependency or select different task

**Workflow Position**:

```mermaid

## Examples

### Example 1: Auto Mode with Inferences

```bash
/refine-task --task-id=FE0012
```

**Pipeline Execution**:

1. `context.load-task` → Found vague task description
2. `onboard.analyze-clarity` → Clarity: 35% (major gaps)
3. `onboard.refine-requirements` → Made 4 assumptions based on similar tasks
4. `review.validate-testability` → Testability: 88%

**Result**: Readiness 85% - Ready for planning with documented assumptions

---

### Example 2: Interactive Mode

```bash
/refine-task --task-id=BE0045 --interactive
```

**Pipeline Execution**:

1. `context.load-task` → Task loaded, missing security details
2. `onboard.analyze-clarity` → Clarity: 45% (P0 gaps in security)
3. `onboard.refine-requirements` → Asked 5 questions about security/validation
4. User answered questions
5. `review.validate-testability` → Testability: 92%

**Result**: Readiness 90% - Ready for planning with user-validated requirements

---

### Example 3: Already Well-Defined Task

```bash
/refine-task --task-id=TEST0008
```

**Pipeline Execution**:

1. `context.load-task` → Task has complete details
2. `onboard.analyze-clarity` → Clarity: 92% (minor edge case gap)
3. `onboard.refine-requirements` → Added 1 edge case criterion
4. `review.validate-testability` → Testability: 95%

**Result**: Readiness 95% - Excellent, proceed to planning immediately

---

## Notes

### When to Use This Command

**Always use after `/fetch-task`** when:

- Task is P0/P1 (critical work)
- Acceptance criteria are vague or missing
- Task is from high-level backlog requiring detail

**Can skip** (proceed directly to `/plan`) when:

- Task is very simple (XS effort, clear scope)
- Task was previously refined (has detailed criteria)
- Small bugfix with explicit requirements

### Mode Selection

**Interactive Mode** (`--interactive`):

- Use when: P0 gaps exist, task is critical, multiple interpretations possible
- Benefit: User-validated requirements, no assumptions
- Trade-off: Requires user availability and input

**Auto Mode** (default):

- Use when: Patterns exist in codebase, time pressure, P1/P2 tasks
- Benefit: Fast, autonomous, leverages existing patterns
- Trade-off: Relies on assumptions (documented and flagged)

### Handling Low Readiness

If readiness < 70% after refinement:

1. **Try `/gather-knowledge`** - May need more codebase context
2. **Re-run with `--interactive`** - Get direct user clarification
3. **Check dependencies** - May be blocked by other tasks
4. **Consider task splitting** - May be too large/complex
5. **Escalate** - May need product/stakeholder input

### Prompt Reusability

- `context.load-task` - Reusable for any task loading scenario
- `onboard.analyze-clarity` - Reusable for requirements/specifications analysis
- `review.validate-testability` - Reusable for any acceptance criteria validation
- All prompts follow consistent patterns from existing prompts
